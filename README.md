### Installation Instruction

> to install the dependencies
`bundle install`

> in the bowser go to:

### Tech Used
`html5, scss, javascript, bootstrap, gulp.js`

### Methodology
I approach this test trying to built the website from the bottom to the footer doing each part at a time.

I decided to use bootstrap for the carousel as I figured given the about of time I will not have enough time to build it using plain js and css.

However I haven't make use of any other bootstrap components in this project. It would have made the mobile friendly version much easier to do.


### Incomplete (what I would do if i had more that 4 hours)
How I would approach this test given another shot:

- mobile first
- various style tweaks
